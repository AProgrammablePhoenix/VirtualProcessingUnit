This project allows you to run an engine which emulates threading behaviour. It allows you to run tasks in parallel in consequence.  
Actually, the language used to run tasks is not directly C++, it's VASM (which means Virtual ASM), which is a language that is representing
simplified Assembly (really simplified) with pre-built procedures for string manipulations.

Towards V1.8:
- [x] Add support for 'char' type
- [ ] Add support for 'double' type
- [ ] Add those two types to the compiler
- [ ] Add those two types to the instructions set of VAS and VEXE.
