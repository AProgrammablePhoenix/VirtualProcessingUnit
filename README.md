This project allows you to run an engine which emulates threading behaviour. It allows you to run tasks in parallel in consequence.  
Actually, the language used to run tasks is not directly C++, it's VASM (which means Virtual ASM), which is a language that is representing
simplified Assembly (really simplified) with pre-built procedures for string manipulations.

Towards V1.7:
- [ ] Create an executable format (VEXE :: Virtual Executable) which will be handled and executed by a specific virtual executable runner.
- [ ] Create the VEXE handler/runner.
