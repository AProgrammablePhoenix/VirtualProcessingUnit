This project allows you to run an engine which emulates threading behaviour. It allows you to run tasks in parallel in consequence.  
Actually, the language used to run tasks is not directly C++, it's VASM (which means Virtual ASM), which is a language that is representing
simplified Assembly (really simplified) with pre-built procedures for string manipulations.

Towards V1.6:
- [x] Add structure pointer in registers (type::string)
- [x] Implement 'structs' building system
- [x] Implement 'structs' user symbols
