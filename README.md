This project allows you to run an engine which emulates some sort of CPU behavior. Actually, the language used to run tasks is not directly C++, 
it's VASM (which means Virtual ASM), which is a language that is representing simplified Assembly (really simplified) with pre-built procedures 
for some high-level operations.

As no new update is planned and the focus is set on implementing SVASM, please go [here](https://github.com/AProgrammablePhoenix/VirtualThreadingEngine/tree/main/SVASM)
to stay up to date on the advancement of the implementation.
